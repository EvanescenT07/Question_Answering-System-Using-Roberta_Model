# Question Answering System Using RoBERTa Model

This project is a final submission for a Natural Language Processing (NLP) course. It implements a Question Answering System using the RoBERTa pretrained model and the SQuAD dataset.

## Project Overview

The system leverages the RoBERTa model to answer questions based on the SQuAD dataset. It employs various libraries and tools for effective model training and evaluation, including:

- `wandb` for experiment tracking and visualization
- `simpletransformers` for simplified model interfacing
- `json`, `re`, and `nltk` for data processing and manipulation

## Getting Started

To explore the project and view the output, visit the Google Colab notebook:
[Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19w78i7DX12QjKwtjjaBC0u9YSPUVddK4?authuser=2#scrollTo=x6Z1MMdbGGtx)

## Setup and Dependencies

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- `wandb`
- `simpletransformers`
- `json`
- `nltk`

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install wandb simpletransformers nltk json
```

## Dataset

The project uses the SQuAD dataset in JSON format. Ensure the dataset is available and correctly formatted for the system to function properly.

## Usage

Follow the instructions in the Google Colab notebook for running and experimenting with the Question Answering System.

## Additional Information

For more details on the implementation and parameters used, refer to the project documentation in the Colab notebook.
